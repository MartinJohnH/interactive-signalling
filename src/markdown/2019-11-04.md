###Accreditation
David Clark who heads up the Visualization Studio in the Concordia Library, introduced our team to the many facets of the space.  We spent about one and one half hours going through the technical functions as well as the administrative requirements to be able to use the space.

We continued with our prototyping in the Technology Sandbox and were successful in actually making the gnuradio software produce some data with the raspberry pi 3 microcontroller and the SDR (DVB-T+DAB+FM).  Unfortunately, the data was all zeroes which we suspect is not correct.
