###Final Presentation
Today we showed our project to the class.   

We had all our required equipment that we picked up from the CDA Depot.  We set up in one of the labs on the 5th floor. We checked with Sonia (from CDA Depot) to confirm that the room would be available to use for our final presentation.

The team showed up a few hours before the Presentation and we started to set up.

We did some final touch ups on the sound files.

We were ready to present on time.
