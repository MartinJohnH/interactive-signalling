###Space prospecting
During today's class we gave our teacher Brad a quick run down on our progress of the project. He was satisfactory with the development of the project. He was surprised with the information that we were able to acquire.
During the studio time we were allowed to go off on our own and work on what was needed to be done. The first thing we did was look at two different rooms to see how big they were. We then worked in one of the rooms with some CDA equipment that we borrowed which included a mini projector and a large projector with a laptop and speakers that came with a trolly.

The trolly was around the same length of how we want our center piece to be.

What was able to get done in the room was; we were able to hook up two projectors to the laptop and were able to project onto black currents that were hanging from the ceiling of the room.

The main purpose of the day was to check out the rooms and start testing out equipment.
