###Post Mortem
Today, we did another final presentation for the project in the Visualization Studio in the Concordia Library on Brad's recommendation following last week's presentation. This permitted us to take advantage of the touch screen, sound and visual installation.

David Clark suggested we change our background to black to minimize the grid display of the many monitors.  We invited Sandbox members to try our interactive environemnt.

Some of the highlights include :
