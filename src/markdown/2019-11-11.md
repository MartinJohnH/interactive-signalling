###Prototyping
During today's class we went to the metal shop to get a piece of metal because the software defined radio (SDR) needs a piece of metal for the antenna, the maquet shop to look at wood and also took measurements to test sizes for our projector stand.

Once that was done we went to the Sandbox to test out a the raspberry pi 3 microcontroller with the SDR (DVB-T+DAB+FM). We are in the process of testing the raspberry pie with the SDF. We are using gqxr.
