###Data Base
We met in class and updated Brad on our progress.  Brad will look into some alternatives to gnuradio.  

We split up today to complete the shopping of equipment and creation of the database.  

Jessica and Gabriel left to go shopping for two Raspberry Pis 4 and chargers, 3 mini hdmi to hdmi cables and heat sinks at Abra Electronics.

Martin-John created some frontend visuals to show what we can generate with some data going into P5 js library.

Martin-John and Ariana worked in a classroom on a real time Firebase database creation and the web site blog posts.  The database is set up with mock data in order to move forward on the Max MSP component of the project.  Today's goal is to connect the website to the database.
