###unboxing the PI and setup of the PI  
We met in class and updated Brad on our progress.   

We went to the sandbox to set up the Raspberry PIs, we loaded all the software that was needed which was Wireshark. we created some test data with the wire shark. We set up a landing page on Git Hub.

We created our QR code.
